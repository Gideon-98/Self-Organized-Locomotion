# Self-Organized-Locomotion

This study focuses on the development and implementation of a self-organized locomotion control system for a hexapod robot, drawing inspiration from the walking mechanics and morphology of insects. Utilizing real insect trajectory data, the research aims to create a biologically inspired control model capable of adaptive gait patterns. The primary objective is to enable the hexapod robot to achieve a self-organized locomotion by adaptation on foot feedback. In this way, a scattered control system is developed, based on distributed neural central pattern generators (CPGs) for generating basic leg movements and an adaptive sensory feedback mechanism for generating self-organized phase relationships among the local CPG circuits. The methodology includes additionally a forward model integrated with dual rate learning for adaptive control. Experimental results highlight the system's ability to produce intralimb coordination, although challenges remain in achieving a stable, self-organized gait. The findings underscore the potential of neural-based adaptive control mechanisms in robotics, while also pointing to areas for further refinement and enhanced versatilty.
