# Central Pattern Generator (CPG)
A Central Pattern Generator is a 



## Weights
According to this, the synaptic weights are described as:
$$
W_{11,22}=W_{d 0}, \\
W_{12_m}=W_{d 1}+M I, \\
W_{21_m}=-(W_{d 1}+MI),
$$
where $W_{11,22}$ are fixed synapses and $W_{12_m,21_m}$ are modulated synapses. $W_{d0}$ and $W_{d 1}$ are the default synaptic weights, which are used to create basic periodic signals. They need to be selected in accordance with the dynamics of the system that generates periodic or quasi-periodic attractors (Pasemann et al., 2003).

## MI

walking speed is proportional to the value of MI. However, the walking speed will decrease if MI is grater than 0.19. (in theirs experiment).
